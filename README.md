# Comp-Sci-2-Projects
All of these programs are projects coded in python my sophmore year of high school.
The course taught a strong foundation in python and laid the groundwork to allow me
to learn more and master python on my own. These projects assessed my python skills
from using different objects (such as stacks) to learning object-oriented code/how
to use and make classes. This course was not a simply intro couse to python, though,
as Computer Science 1, which I took my freshman year, was taught in scheme and 
taught programming skills, such as recursion, that can be applied to any langauge.
